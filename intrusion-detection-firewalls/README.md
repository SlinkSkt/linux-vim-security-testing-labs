# Linux & Vim Security Testing Labs

This repository contains **Linux-based cybersecurity lab work**, written and configured using **Vim** and standard command-line security tools.  
The lab focuses on practical security testing, defensive configuration, and protocol analysis in a Linux environment.

All experiments were performed hands-on using Linux systems, with an emphasis on understanding *why* security controls work, not just how to configure them.

## What This Lab Covers

The lab explores intrusion detection, firewall configuration, cryptography usage, network reconnaissance, and secure coding analysis on Linux systems.  
Tools such as **Snort**, **iptables**, **OpenSSL**, **Nmap**, and **FlawFinder** are used directly from the command line, with **Vim** as the primary editor for rules, configuration files, and scripts.

Key topics include detecting malicious traffic, designing stateless and stateful firewall rules, analyzing encryption modes (ECB vs CBC), scanning and fingerprinting hosts, and identifying common software vulnerabilities.
