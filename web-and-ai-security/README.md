# Linux & Vim Web Security Labs

This repository section contains **Linux-based web security lab work**, written and analysed using **Vim** and standard command-line tools.  
The lab focuses on identifying, exploiting, and understanding common web application vulnerabilities in controlled environments.

All experiments were conducted hands-on in Linux systems, with an emphasis on understanding how real-world vulnerabilities arise and how they are abused by attackers.

## What This Lab Covers

The lab explores common and impactful web security vulnerabilities, including SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).  
It also includes security analysis of machine learning systems through adversarial attacks, demonstrating how modern AI models can be intentionally misled.

All attacks and analysis were performed from Linux environments, with configuration files, scripts, and payloads written and reviewed using Vim.

Key topics include authentication bypass using SQL injection, stored XSS and XSS worms, malicious client-side script execution, and adversarial evasion attacks against AI classification models.
