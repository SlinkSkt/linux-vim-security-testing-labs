# Linux & Vim Security Labs

This repository is a collection of **hands-on cybersecurity labs conducted in a Linux environment**, using **Vim as the primary editor** and standard command-line security tools.

The work focuses on practical testing, secure configuration, exploitation, and analysis of real security problems, rather than abstract theory.

## What This Repository Demonstrates

Across multiple labs, this repository covers defensive and offensive security concepts including intrusion detection, firewall design, cryptography usage, web application vulnerabilities, and adversarial attacks against AI systems.

All labs were executed directly on Linux systems, with configurations, rules, and scripts written and maintained using Vim. This reflects real-world workflows used in security operations and engineering.

## Lab Areas

The repository is organised into two main lab areas:

### Intrusion Detection & Firewalls
This area focuses on detecting malicious traffic, controlling network access, and analysing traffic behaviour using Snort and iptables.

### Web & AI Security
This area explores web application vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting, and includes security analysis of machine learning models under adversarial attack.

Each lab area contains its own README with detailed explanations and links to full lab reports.

---

## Documentation

Each lab includes a full Google Docs report linked inside its folder. These documents contain detailed explanations, screenshots, evidence, and analysis supporting the hands-on work.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a **technical security portfolio**, demonstrating Linux security tooling, disciplined command-line workflows, and practical security reasoning suitable for entry-level security, SOC, or security engineering roles.
